#Introduction:

360 ey! Script is a simple way to transform your current animations in 360 degrees (equirectangular) projects. You can also create new compositions from scratch and modify them on the fly without third party plug-ins. This allow you to redistribute your projects with more freedom.
Our main public are content creators who want to give their customers the ability to render 360 degrees animations from a template without the need to purchase expensive plug-ins and 360 Degrees video creators who need a quick, inexpensive and easy way to add animations to their productions.
